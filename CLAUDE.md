## What is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO is an SEO strategy that leverages **automation and templates to generate and optimize a large volume of web pages** by using data to populate templates, creating numerous pages efficiently. It focuses on targeting long-tail keywords with lower competition.

**Examples:**
- Tripadvisor: "Things to do in [City]" - thousands of city pages from one template
- Zillow: "[City] Real Estate" - location-based property pages
- Yelp: "Best [Business Type] in [City]" - local business directory pages

**Key Formula: Template + Data = Scale**

## Project Overview

The Programmatic SEO Tool is a versatile bulk page generator that works for ANY business type. It creates hundreds or thousands of SEO-optimized pages by combining templates with data.

### Core Features

1. **Business Analysis & Template Discovery**
   - Analyzes any business URL/description to understand offerings
   - Identifies template opportunities based on search patterns

2. **Template Management System**
   - Create reusable page templates with variable placeholders
   - Support multiple template types (location, comparison, use-case, feature)
   - Template library for common patterns

3. **Data-Driven Page Generation**
   - Import data via CSV or manual entry
   - Generate all possible combinations from template + data
   - Ensure unique elements on each page

4. **Bulk Page Creation**
   - Generate hundreds/thousands of pages from single template
   - SEO optimization built into every page
   - Maintain consistent structure while ensuring uniqueness

5. **Export & Publishing**
   - Export as CSV with all page data
   - WordPress XML format
   - Direct CMS integration capabilities

## Development Guidelines

When implementing features:
1. **Template First**: Always think in terms of templates and data, not individual pages
2. **Universal Design**: Ensure features work for ANY business type
3. **Data Validation**: Validate all imported data for quality
4. **Uniqueness**: Each generated page must have unique elements beyond the template
5. **SEO Built-in**: Every page must be SEO-optimized by default
6. **Scale Testing**: Test with hundreds of combinations to ensure performance

## Deployment Configuration (CRITICAL)

**This project uses a separated architecture: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Railway**

### Current Deployment Architecture
1. **Frontend**: Next.js deployed on Vercel
2. **Backend**: FastAPI deployed on Railway (separate project)
3. **Communication**: Frontend calls Railway backend via environment variable URL
4. **Why Separated**: Vercel couldn't handle mixed Python/Next.js well (discovered during development)

### Deployment URLs
- **Frontend (Vercel)**: https://programmatic-seo-tool.vercel.app
- **Backend (Railway)**: https://programmaticseotool-production.up.railway.app

### Frontend (Vercel) Requirements
1. **Next.js Only**: Pure Next.js frontend, no Python
2. **Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to Railway backend
3. **API Calls**: Use axios client with backend URL from environment
4. **CORS**: Backend configured to accept Vercel frontend origin

### Backend (Railway) Requirements
1. **FastAPI Application**: Full backend in `/backend` directory
2. **Database**: SQLite for persistence
3. **Environment Variables**: AI provider keys set in Railway
4. **CORS Middleware**: Configured to accept frontend domain

### All Subagents MUST Follow These Rules:
1. **Keep frontend and backend separate** - they deploy to different platforms
2. **Use environment variable for API URL** in frontend (not hardcoded)
3. **Frontend uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** for all API calls
4. **Test CORS configuration** when making API changes
5. **Update both deployments** when making breaking changes

### Current vercel.json Structure (Frontend Only):
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## Workflow Rules

When working on any development task, follow these steps:

1. **First think through the problem** - Read the codebase for relevant files and write a plan to tasks/todo.md
2. **Create checkable todo items** - The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. **Check in before starting** - Before beginning work, verify the plan with the user
4. **Work systematically** - Begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go
5. **Provide high-level explanations** - Every step of the way, give a high-level explanation of what changes were made
6. **Keep it simple** - Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. **Add review section** - Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information

## Development Commands

### Run Locally
```bash
# Option 1: Run both servers with one command
python run_local.py

# Option 2: Run servers separately
# Terminal 1 - API (FastAPI)
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (Next.js)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Initialize Database
```bash
python init_db.py
```

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/analyze-business` - Analyze business from text or URL
- `POST /api/generate-templates` - Generate programmatic SEO template opportunities
- `POST /api/create-template` - Create or save a page template
- `POST /api/import-data` - Import data for template variables
- `POST /api/generate-pages` - Generate all pages from template + data
- `POST /api/export` - Export pages (CSV, JSON, WordPress)

## Environment Variables Required

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `PerplexityAPI` - At least one AI provider
- Optional: `WORDPRESS_URL`, `WORDPRESS_USERNAME`, `WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD` for direct publishing

## Important Implementation Notes

### What Works (Keep These)
1. **Perplexity API Configuration**: Use model "sonar" - tested and working
2. **URL Content Extraction**: Current implementation successfully extracts business info
3. **Business Analysis**: `analyze_business_comprehensive()` provides good foundation
4. **Content Variation Engine**: Uniqueness algorithms work well for bulk pages
5. **Vercel Deployment**: Current setup works without filesystem errors

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Don't focus on keyword discovery** - Users will provide their own data
2. **Don't estimate traffic/metrics** - Focus on page generation only
3. **Don't create complex wizards** - Simple template â†’ data â†’ pages flow
4. **Don't generate individual content** - Think bulk generation from templates

## Current Status (As of January 2025)

### âœ… Completed (January 11, 2025 - Latest Testing Session)
- **Backend Deployment**: Successfully deployed minimal FastAPI backend on Railway
- **Frontend-Backend Connection**: Frontend on Vercel connected to Railway backend
- **Business Analysis API**: Working endpoint with Perplexity AI integration
- **AI Response Parsing**: Fixed JSON parsing from Perplexity markdown responses
- **API Connectivity**: Full frontend-backend communication working
- **Business Analysis**: AI successfully analyzes businesses and suggests templates
- **Template Creation**: Templates can be created with proper variable format ({Variable} not [Variable])
- **Project Management**: Full CRUD operations for projects working

### ðŸ”§ Key Learnings from Testing (January 11, 2025)
1. **AI Integration Works**: Perplexity API successfully generates relevant template suggestions
2. **Variable Format**: Templates must use {Variable} format, not [Variable]
3. **Data Format**: API expects list of dictionaries, not dictionary of lists
4. **URL Content Fetching**: Needs improvement - currently doesn't fetch actual page content
5. **Critical UX Issue**: Requiring users to create CSV files is a major friction point

### ðŸš¨ Critical Feature Gap Discovered
**Manual CSV creation is killing the user experience!** Users currently must:
- Understand what columns are needed
- Create properly formatted CSV files
- Match exact column names to template variables
- Generate their own data

**This defeats the entire purpose of an easy-to-use programmatic SEO tool.**

### ðŸ’¡ Solution: AI-Powered Automatic Data Generation
The tool should use AI to automatically generate relevant data based on:
1. Business context (e.g., real estate, social media tools)
2. Template pattern (e.g., "Best {Service} in {City}")
3. Target market (e.g., Canadian cities, US states)

### ðŸš€ Working Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/test` - Test endpoint  
- `POST /api/analyze-business` - AI-powered business analysis
- Full project, template, data, and page generation APIs

## Current Status (Original)
