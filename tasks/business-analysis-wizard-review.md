# Business Analysis Wizard Implementation Review

## Summary of Changes

Created a multi-step business analysis wizard for the Programmatic SEO Tool following the MCP specifications. The wizard guides users through analyzing their business and receiving template suggestions.

## Components Created

### 1. BusinessAnalysisForm Component
- **Location**: `/components/business/BusinessAnalysisForm.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dual input modes: text description or URL
  - Form validation with error messages
  - Visual toggle between input types
  - Example inputs for user guidance
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 2. LoadingAnimation Component
- **Location**: `/components/business/LoadingAnimation.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Animated bouncing dots loader
  - Progress messages showing analysis steps
  - Clean, minimal design

### 3. TemplateResults Component
- **Location**: `/components/business/TemplateResults.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays business analysis summary
  - Shows template opportunities with difficulty indicators
  - Interactive template cards with hover effects
  - Icons based on template type (location, comparison, etc.)
  - Estimated pages count for each template

### 4. Main Wizard Page Update
- **Location**: `/app/projects/new/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated all three new components
  - Implemented state management for wizard steps
  - Added API integration with `/api/analyze-business` endpoint
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Progress bar updates based on current step

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses relative path `/api/analyze-business` for Vercel deployment
- Sends POST request with:
  ```json
  {
    "business_input": string,
    "input_type": "text" | "url"
  }
  ```
- Handles response matching the backend's BusinessAnalysisResponse model

### TypeScript Interfaces
- Properly typed all components and API responses
- Matches backend response structure:
  - `business_name`, `business_description`, `target_audience`
  - `core_offerings` array
  - `template_opportunities` with pattern, examples, and difficulty

### Styling
- Used Tailwind CSS throughout for consistency
- Responsive design principles
- Hover states and transitions for better UX
- Color-coded difficulty indicators (green/yellow/red)

## Additional Changes

### Configuration
- Created `tailwind.config.ts` to properly configure custom colors
- Fixed CSS variable references for shadcn/ui components

### Code Quality
- Fixed all ESLint errors
- Proper React escape sequences for quotes and apostrophes
- Removed unused imports

## Next Steps

The wizard is now fully functional and ready for testing. Future enhancements could include:
1. Integration with subsequent steps (template selection, data import)
2. Save/resume functionality for analysis results
3. More detailed template preview
4. Export analysis results

## Testing Notes

The wizard should be tested with various business inputs:
- Text descriptions of different business types
- Valid and invalid URLs
- Edge cases (very short descriptions, malformed URLs)

The API endpoint at `/api/analyze-business` must be running and accessible for the wizard to function properly.
