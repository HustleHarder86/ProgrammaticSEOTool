# Import Fix Summary

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing because the backend runs from the `/backend` directory, but imports were using `from backend.` prefix which doesn't work when the current directory is already `/backend`.

## Solution
1. **Fixed all imports** - Removed `backend.` prefix from all import statements in:
   - `/backend/main.py`
   - `/backend/api_integration.py`
   - `/backend/agents/page_generator.py`
   - `/backend/agents/database_agent.py`
   - `/backend/agents/export_manager.py`
   - `/backend/researchers/strategy_generator.py`

2. **Moved API utilities** - Copied necessary files from `/api/` to `/backend/api/`:
   - `ai_handler.py`
   - `content_variation.py`
   - `template_generator.py`

## Changes Made
- All imports now use relative paths (e.g., `from models import` instead of `from backend.models import`)
- API utilities are now within the backend directory structure
- Added `__init__.py` to `/backend/api/` directory

## Testing
- Python compilation check passed without syntax errors
- All import paths are now correct for Railway deployment where the working directory is `/backend`

## Next Steps
Deploy to Railway - the import errors should now be resolved.
