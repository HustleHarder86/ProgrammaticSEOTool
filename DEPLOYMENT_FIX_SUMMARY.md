# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The Vercel deployment was returning a 404 error because Python backend files were mixed with Next.js frontend files in the `app/` directory, preventing Next.js from properly routing pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Backend Directory Structure
- Created `backend/` directory with proper subdirectories:
  - `backend/agents/`
  - `backend/generators/`
  - `backend/researchers/`
  - `backend/exporters/`
  - `backend/templates/`
  - `backend/utils/`

### 2. Moved All Python Files
- Moved all Python files from `app/` to `backend/`:
  - `__init__.py`, `main.py`, `models.py`, `api_integration.py`
  - All agent files to `backend/agents/`
  - All other Python modules to their respective directories
- Also moved `api/main.py` to `backend/api_main.py`

### 3. Updated Import Paths
- Updated all Python imports from `from app.` to `from backend.`
- Updated all `import app.` to `import backend.`

### 4. Cleaned App Directory
- Removed empty Python directories from `app/`
- Removed `__pycache__` directories
- Now `app/` contains only Next.js files:
  - `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `globals.css`, `favicon.ico`
  - `providers.tsx`
  - `demo/page.tsx`
  - `projects/new/page.tsx`

### 5. Updated Configuration
- Updated `vercel.json` to use Next.js configuration only
- Removed Python function references

### 6. Verification
- Successfully ran `npm install`
- Successfully ran `npm run build`
- Next.js build completed without errors

## Next Steps for Full Deployment

### Option 1: Separate Backend Deployment
Deploy the Python backend separately using:
- Railway, Render, or Heroku for the Python API
- Update frontend to call the external API endpoint

### Option 2: Serverless Functions
Convert critical Python endpoints to Next.js API routes in TypeScript

### Option 3: Monorepo with Separate Deployments
- Deploy frontend to Vercel
- Deploy backend to a Python-compatible platform
- Use environment variables for API URLs

## Current Status
✅ Frontend is now ready for Vercel deployment
✅ Clean separation between frontend and backend code
✅ All Python imports updated to use `backend.` namespace
✅ Next.js build succeeds without errors

The 404 error should now be resolved when deploying to Vercel.
