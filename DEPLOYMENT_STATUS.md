âœ… Pushed export functionality fixes to GitHub
- Commit: d920b98
- Branch: master

## What Was Fixed
- Fixed case sensitivity issue causing export failures
- Changed `settings.exports_dir` to `settings.EXPORTS_DIR` in 5 files

## Railway Deployment
Railway should automatically:
1. Detect the GitHub push
2. Start building the new backend
3. Deploy the updated code

## How to Verify Deployment
1. Check Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Look for the deployment status
3. Once deployed (usually 2-3 minutes), test export functionality

## Testing After Deployment
```bash
# You can run this test script after deployment completes:
python3 test_export_fix.py
```

## Expected Result
Export functionality should work correctly after deployment completes.
