  "created_at": "2025-01-11",
  "priority": "CRITICAL",
  
  "objective": "Create an AI-powered system that generates relevant variables (like city names) based on business context from step 1 and template structure from step 2, showing all potential page titles for user selection before full page generation",
  
  "context": {
    "problem": "Users currently must manually create CSV files with correct column names and relevant data, which is a major UX blocker",
    "solution": "AI intelligently generates variables based on business context and template pattern, shows all titles for user review/selection",
    "impact": "Users can see exactly what pages will be created and select which ones they want before generation"
  },
  
  "workflow": {
    "step_1": "User analyzes business (e.g., Canadian Real Estate Investment Tool)",
    "step_2": "User selects template (e.g., '{City} with Best Investment Potential')",
    "step_3": "AI generates variables based on context (e.g., 25 Canadian cities)",
    "step_4": "User sees all potential titles and can select all/some",
    "step_5": "System generates full pages only for selected titles"
