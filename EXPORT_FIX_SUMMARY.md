# Export Functionality Fix Summary
**Date: January 12, 2025**

## Issue Identified
The export functionality was failing with the error:
```
'Settings' object has no attribute 'exports_dir'
```

## Root Cause
Case sensitivity mismatch between the configuration and code:
- **config.py** defined: `EXPORTS_DIR` (uppercase)
- **Code was using**: `settings.exports_dir` (lowercase)

## Files Fixed
1. `backend/exporters/csv_exporter.py`
2. `backend/exporters/wordpress_exporter.py`
3. `backend/agents/export_manager.py`
4. `backend/main_complex.py`
5. `backend/api_integration.py`

## Solution Applied
Changed all occurrences of `settings.exports_dir` to `settings.EXPORTS_DIR` to match the configuration.

## Testing Required
After deploying this fix to Railway:
1. Test CSV export functionality
2. Test JSON export functionality
3. Test WordPress export functionality
4. Test HTML export functionality

## Deployment Steps
1. Push the changes to GitHub
2. Railway should automatically deploy the updated backend
3. Test the export functionality through the frontend

## Expected Result
Export functionality should now work correctly, creating export files in the `/backend/data/exports` directory on Railway.
