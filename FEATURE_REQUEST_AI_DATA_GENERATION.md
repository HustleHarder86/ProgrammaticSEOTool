# Feature Request: AI-Powered Automatic Data Generation

## Problem
Users currently have to manually create CSV files with the correct column names and relevant data. This is a major friction point that defeats the purpose of an easy-to-use programmatic SEO tool.

## Solution
Implement AI-powered automatic data generation that creates relevant data based on:
1. Business context
2. Template pattern
3. Target market/audience

## Implementation Details

### 1. When user clicks "Generate Pages" or "Import Data":
Instead of requiring CSV upload, show an AI data generation option:

```
🤖 Generate Data with AI (Recommended)
📁 Upload CSV File
✏️ Enter Data Manually
```

### 2. AI Data Generation Flow:

```python
def generate_template_data(template_pattern, business_context, variables):
    """
    Use AI to generate relevant data for template variables
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Business Context: {business_context}
    Template Pattern: {template_pattern}
    Variables Needed: {variables}
    
    Generate 25-50 relevant data entries for these variables that would:
    1. Be relevant to the business
    2. Have good search volume potential
    3. Make sense for the target audience
    
    Return as JSON array with objects containing the variable names as keys.
    """
    
    # AI generates data
    # User can preview and edit
    # Then proceed to page generation
```

### 3. Smart Defaults by Variable Type:

- **[City]** → Major cities in target market
- **[Neighborhood]** → Popular neighborhoods in major cities  
- **[Industry]** → Relevant industries for the business
- **[Platform]** → Relevant platforms (social, business, etc.)
- **[Service]** → Services related to the business
- **[Product]** → Products in the business category

### 4. Example for Real Estate Template:

**Input:**
- Business: Real Estate Investment Analysis Tool
- Template: "Best Short-Term Rental Investment Properties in [City]"

**AI Output:**
```json
[
  {"City": "Toronto"},
  {"City": "Vancouver"},
  {"City": "Montreal"},
  {"City": "Calgary"},
  {"City": "Ottawa"},
  // ... 20 more cities based on:
  // - Population size
  // - Tourism activity  
  // - Short-term rental demand
  // - Investment potential
]
```

## Benefits
1. **Zero friction** - Users don't need to understand CSV formats
2. **Intelligent data** - AI ensures relevant, high-value data
3. **Time saving** - Generate hundreds of pages in minutes
4. **Better SEO** - AI can consider search volume and competition

## UI Mockup
```

## Priority: CRITICAL
This feature would dramatically improve user experience and is essential for making the tool truly useful for non-technical users.
